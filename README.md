# Folder structure

## `src/`
- `dist/` contains the .java flies generated by ANTLR4
- `grammar/` contains the grammar (.g4) files that ANTLR4 uses to generate the parser
- `helpers/` contains helper classes, e.g. LexerHelper that handles indent/dedent in the lexer
- `input-files/` contains the files, which the parser is tested on
- `App.java` the main entry for the parser
## `lib/`
- `antlr-4.12.0-complete.jar` contains the ANLTR4 framework
## `bin/` 
- Same structure as `src/` but contains all the .class files compiled from the .java files in `src/`
## `extensions/`
- `sudocode/` contains the extension that supports syntax highlighting of .sudocode files

# Scripts
### `build.sh`
Generates and compiles the lexer and parser.

### `run.sh`
Runs the parser by running the `App`. This script also builds the parser, so running `build.sh` is not necessary.

### `updateExt.sh`
Re-installs the `sudocode/` extension. This is needed for changes in the extension to take effect. Make sure to run `npm install` before running this script for the first time. Also, the `code` CLI must be available for this script to work. 

# Get started
Java Development Kit (JDK) of version 8 or above is required to run ANTLR4. When it is installed the `run.sh` script will build and run the parser.

>**Note:** On Windows the .sh scripts cannot be run directly. They can either be run through WSL or by running each command one at a time.
